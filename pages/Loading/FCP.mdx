# First Contentful Paint (FCP)

### Overview

Quick check for [First Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/articles/fcp), the metric that marks when the browser renders the first piece of DOM content — text, image, canvas, or SVG. FCP measures the user's perception of whether the page is loading.

Unlike LCP, FCP fires as soon as _any_ content appears, making it the earliest signal of loading progress. A slow FCP almost always points to TTFB or render-blocking resources.

**FCP Rating Thresholds:**

| Rating | Time | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| 🟢 Good | ≤ 1.8s | Content appears quickly |
| 🟡 Needs Improvement | ≤ 3s | Noticeable delay |
| 🔴 Poor | > 3s | Users may perceive the page as broken |

> **Render-blocking resources?** Use [Find Render-Blocking Resources](/Loading/Find-render-blocking-resources) for a detailed analysis with recommendations.

### Phase Breakdown

The three phases explain where time is spent before the first pixel is painted:

| Phase | Measured as | Optimization |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **TTFB** | `responseStart` — time until first byte of HTML arrives | Server response time, CDN, caching |
| **Render-blocking load** | Time blocked waiting for CSS/JS before the browser can paint | Defer/async scripts, inline critical CSS |
| **Render delay** | Time from resources ready to actual paint | CSS complexity, main thread contention |

> **Browser support:** The render-blocking phase requires the `renderBlockingStatus` API (Chrome 107+, Edge 107+). In other browsers the render-blocking section will show no resources even if they exist.
