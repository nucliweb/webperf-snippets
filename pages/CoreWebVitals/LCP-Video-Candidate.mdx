# LCP Video Candidate

Detects whether the LCP element is a `<video>` and audits the poster image configuration — the most common source of avoidable LCP delay when video is the hero element.

When a `<video>` element has a `poster` attribute, the browser treats the poster image as the LCP candidate. The browser cannot discover the poster URL until the parser reaches the `<video>` tag, so without a `<link rel="preload">` the poster is fetched late, increasing LCP.

**What this snippet checks:**

| Check                                                       | Scope                        |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| LCP element is a `<video>`                                  | Last LCP entry               |
| Missing `poster` attribute                                  | LCP video                    |
| No `<link rel="preload" as="image">` for the poster         | LCP video poster             |
| Preload link without `fetchpriority="high"`                 | LCP video poster preload     |
| Poster using a legacy format (not AVIF / WebP / JXL)        | LCP video poster             |
| `renderTime` is zero (cross-origin poster, TAO header missing) | LCP video poster          |

### Overview

When a `<video>` drives LCP, the critical path for the poster image mirrors that of an LCP `<img>`:

```
HTML parsing → <video> tag discovered → poster URL extracted → poster fetch starts → poster decoded → LCP painted
```

A `<link rel="preload">` in `<head>` shortcuts this chain, allowing the browser to start fetching the poster before the parser reaches the `<video>` tag:

```html
<!-- 1. Preload the poster as early as possible -->
<link rel="preload" as="image" href="poster.avif" fetchpriority="high" />

<!-- 2. Reference the same URL in the video element -->
<video
  autoplay
  muted
  playsinline
  loop
  poster="poster.avif"
  width="1280"
  height="720"
>
  <source src="hero.av1.webm" type="video/webm; codecs=av01.0.04M.08" />
  <source src="hero.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
```

> The `poster` URL in the `<link>` and the `<video>` must be identical — including query strings — so the browser can match them and avoid a duplicate fetch.

### Understanding the Results

#### When LCP is not a `<video>`

The snippet reports the actual LCP element tag and URL, and exits. The [LCP Trail](/CoreWebVitals/LCP-Trail) and [LCP Sub-Parts](/CoreWebVitals/LCP-Sub-Parts) snippets are better suited for diagnosing non-video LCP elements.

#### LCP Metrics

| Field        | Description                                                                                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `LCP time`   | `startTime` from the last LCP entry — the moment the poster was painted to screen                     |
| `Render time`| Time the poster was rendered; `0` means the image is cross-origin without a `Timing-Allow-Origin` header |
| `Load time`  | Time the poster finished loading over the network                                                      |
| `Size`       | Rendered area of the video element in pixels²                                                          |
| `Poster URL` | URL the browser used (`lcp.url`), which may differ from the `poster` attribute if redirected           |
| `Format`     | Image format detected from the URL extension                                                           |

#### Video Element

| Field        | Description                                                                                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `poster`     | Value of the `poster` attribute — must match the preload `href` exactly                      |
| `preload`    | `none` may delay poster loading in non-autoplay videos; `metadata` or `auto` are safer        |
| `autoplay`   | ✓ means the browser starts playback immediately — `muted` is required                        |
| `muted`      | Required for `autoplay` to work in all modern browsers                                        |
| `playsinline`| Prevents iOS Safari from switching to native fullscreen                                       |

#### Preload Link

| Status                          | Meaning                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ found (fetchpriority=high)   | Optimal — browser fetches the poster at the highest priority before parsing the `<video>` tag       |
| ✅ found (no fetchpriority)     | Preload exists but may be deprioritised relative to other `high` resources                          |
| ⚠️ not found                   | Browser cannot start fetching the poster until it parses the `<video>` tag                          |

#### Issues Detected

| Issue                                       | Severity   | Explanation                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No `poster` attribute                       | 🔴 Error   | Without a poster, the browser has no still image to use as LCP candidate                |
| No preload link for poster                  | ⚠️ Warning | Late discovery of the poster directly increases LCP                                      |
| `preload="none"` on non-autoplay video      | ⚠️ Warning | Some browsers delay poster loading until user interaction                                |
| Preload without `fetchpriority="high"`      | ℹ️ Info    | Preload competes with other resources and may not run as early as possible               |
| Poster using legacy format                  | ℹ️ Info    | AVIF / WebP reduces poster file size by 30–50 %, directly lowering load time            |
| `renderTime` is 0                           | ℹ️ Info    | Cross-origin poster without `Timing-Allow-Origin` — accurate LCP timing is unavailable  |

#### `renderTime` and `Timing-Allow-Origin`

The `renderTime` field in an LCP entry is set to `0` when the image is served from a different origin and the server does not include the `Timing-Allow-Origin: *` response header. In that case, `loadTime` can be used as an approximation, but it does not include decoding time.

To expose accurate render timing for cross-origin posters, add the following header to the image response:

```
Timing-Allow-Origin: *
```

#### When to run this snippet

LCP entries accumulate from page load until the first user interaction (click, key press, or scroll). Run the snippet immediately after the page finishes loading, before interacting with it. After a user interaction, `performance.getEntriesByType('largest-contentful-paint')` still returns the entries collected up to that point.
